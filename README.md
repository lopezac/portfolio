# portfolio

This is my personal website/portfolio, I've created it having in mind the
responsive design, I could have added the Firebase backend, but it was an
overkill to a so simple page (used for the projects a good old .json file).

At first I tried to deploy to GitHub pages but, didn't work well and deployed it
on Netlify.

Done with React and I pick the color palette of the page inspired by a shirt of
mine.
